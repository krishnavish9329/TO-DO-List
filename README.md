# TO-Do-List

A To-Do list is a simple yet powerful tool for organizing tasks that need to be completed. It helps individuals or teams track and manage their work by listing tasks, prioritizing them, and marking them off as they are completed. To-Do lists are commonly used in both personal and professional settings to increase productivity and ensure that important tasks are not forgotten.

# Key Features of a TODO List:
## Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks as needed.
## Prioritization: Assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) to focus on the most important ones first.
## Deadlines: Set due dates for tasks to ensure timely completion.
## Categorization: Group tasks into categories or projects to keep things organized.
## Progress Tracking: Mark tasks as complete as you work through the list.
## Reminders/Notifications: Receive reminders to stay on top of deadlines and priorities.
